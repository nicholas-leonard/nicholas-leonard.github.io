Generative AI is everywhere today. We use it for helping us write code, prepare presentations, create avatars, or more generally, automate processes. Generative AI is built using technologies that have been available for years: deep learning and reinforcement learning. Hi, I am Nicholas Léonard. I have been working in the field of machine learning since 2010, when I first learned about AI at the Royal Military College of Canada. After my AI professor gave us a brief overview of artificial neural networks, I ordered a few books about training neural networks. After spending a few years playing around with these, implementing my own backprogration in Python, I left the Canadian Forces to join Professor Yoshua Bengio's MILA lab at the University of Montreal. When he interviewed me, he asked if I knew about the cross-entropy loss function which I did not know about at the time. But I knew about backpropagation or gradient descent, so he accepted my candidacy. That was years ago. At MILA, I learned about symbolic differentiation tools like Theano, Pylearn, and eventually Torch. I learned about cross-validation, holdout sets and the importance of scientific methology. 

Since graduating with a Masters degree in deep learning in 2014, I worked in New York City for a startup getting deep learning vision models working on mobile phones. My active contributions to the open source deep learning library Lua Torch helped me get hired by Twitter in 2016 where I helped improve abuse detection and advertising models. Later, at Expedia Group, after starting as an individual contributor, I moved on to manage a small team of ML Scientists to improve the search engine marketing bidding. I got promoted to Director, ML Science for consistently delivering measurable impact. Eventually, I jumped back to an individual contributor role as Principal Machine Learning Scientist. I was tasked with disrupting the Fraud and Risk Machine Learning pod by introducting cross-domain deep learning models to the team.
